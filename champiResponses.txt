Based on the given list of exercises, I can suggest a workout plan for beginners focusing on legs only. Here's a sample routine:

**Warm-up (5-10 minutes)**

**Leg Day**

1. **Squats**: 3 sets of 8-12 reps
        * Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, then bend knees and lower body until thighs are parallel to the ground. Push back up to the starting position.
2. **Lunges**: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (per leg)
        * Stand with feet together, take a large step forward with one foot, and lower body until back knee almost touches the ground. Push back up to the starting position. Alternate legs.
3. **Leg Press**: 3 sets of 10-15 reps
        * Sit on a leg press machine with your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform. Push the platform away from you, extending your legs.

        * Stand on a step or calf raise platform, then raise up onto your toes and lower back down.

**Cool-down (5 minutes)**

Remember to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you build strength. It's also essential to focus on proper form and technique to avoid injury. As you get stronger and more comfortable, you can always add more exercises or variations to keep challenging yourself!

Please note that this is a general workout plan and may need adjustments based on individual factors such as fitness level, goals, and any physical limitations. Always consult with a healthcare professional or certified personal trainer before starting any new exercise program.
